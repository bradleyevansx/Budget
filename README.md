## 💡 Overview

Budget is a budgeting app made for myself and my wife. It is meant to aid us in tracking our expenses throughout the month. At the moment the workflow is for us to submit transactions throughout the month which I will later mark as tracked as I add them to an excel sheet. Eventually the excel sheet part will be apart of the app.

## ✨ Features

- **🔐 User Authentication:** Secure login with JWT's.
- **🔍 Filtering & Sorting:** Transaction filters to quickly find transactions that meet a certain criteria.
- **📄 Pagination & Analytics:** Navigate large lists and gain insights with charts and dashboards.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** Access on any device with adaptive design.

## 👩‍💻 Tech Stack
